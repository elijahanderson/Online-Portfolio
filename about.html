    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p>I work mainly with Java and Python, but also have experience with many
       other languages, such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C++, and Assembly. I'm
       from Louisville, and I play the guitar. Here
       are some things people say about me:</p><br><br>

    <p>"Eli is not only my favorite son, but is a gentleman and a scholar."
    <br>Mom<br><br><br>
    "I love his t-shirts and he smokes hella weed and works at a cool-ass zoo, definitely the best person I've ever met."
    <br>My friend Richard<br><br><br>
    "Meow."
    <br>Hector<br><br><br>
    "He's ok I guess."
    <br>Grandma Ehrgott</p>
